Alongside with the above technologies, other topics were aborded:

- Server synchronization and effort division
- Websockets (for client notifications)
- HTTPS
- REST API (using Yandex translations)
- Oauth3 (logging in with Facebook)
- MVC model
- Authorization
- Authentication
- Exception handling
- Failover handling (eg. when the primary RMI server fails, the backup RMI server takes action and becomes primary)
- Web-crawling (using jsoup)
